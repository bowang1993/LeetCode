## 题目
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

## 思路
1. 空字符串是不是回文字符串
2. 注意大小写
3. Character中有个方法判断字符是否为 字母或者数字
