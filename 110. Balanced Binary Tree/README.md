## 题目
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

## 思路
哈哈哈！一次就通过了，所以直接就把代码贴上来了。  

1. 递归递归递归
2. 使用递归是真的简单
3. 递归注意好返回值
4. 两个递归
